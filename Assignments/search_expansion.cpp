// youâ€™ll write the search function which will expand the cells with the lowest cost until the goal is reached.

// For that, you will need to represent each cell with a triplet value [g, x, y] where g represents the total cost of expanding toward this cell, x is the row value, and y is the column value.

// Your function should print the final triplet value of the goal once it expands towards it.

/* Steps To Follow
As you expand towards a new cell, check if you have reached the goal; and once you reach it, print its triplet value.
Actively check if you have reached a roadblock. If you do, stop expanding and print a message indicating that you have failed to reach the goal.
Expand the cells with the lowest g value and store your expansions in an open vector. If two cells have equal g values, then you can to pick one of them to expand further.
Each cell in the expansion vector will store the order at which it was expanded. 
Some of the cells were never expanded, and should show a value of -1.
Expansion #: 11
Open List: [10 1 3 ], [10 0 2 ], [9 3 4 ], [9 2 3 ]
Cell Picked: [9 2 3]

The final step is to print the shortest path that the robot has to take in order to travel 
from start to goal. You will need to record each action that the robot should take
(ex: turning left <) and store all the actions in a policy 2D vector.
