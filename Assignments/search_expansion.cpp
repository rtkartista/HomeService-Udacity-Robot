// youâ€™ll write the search function which will expand the cells with the lowest cost until the goal is reached.

// For that, you will need to represent each cell with a triplet value [g, x, y] where g represents the total cost of expanding toward this cell, x is the row value, and y is the column value.

// Your function should print the final triplet value of the goal once it expands towards it.

/* Steps To Follow
As you expand towards a new cell, check if you have reached the goal; and once you reach it, print its triplet value.
Actively check if you have reached a roadblock. If you do, stop expanding and print a message indicating that you have failed to reach the goal.
Expand the cells with the lowest g value and store your expansions in an open vector. If two cells have equal g values, then you can to pick one of them to expand further.
